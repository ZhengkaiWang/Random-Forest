# Random-Forest
Random Forest with CART tree in MATLAB

This is the final project in AU311 Pattern Recognition. We use Bagging+CART/C4.5 tree+Random Forest to achieve a binary classifier. Q. Fan and me implent the C4.5 tree and CART+RF indepently, while Y. Huang collected papers and gave us theoretical support. And in final competition WE GET the FIRST!

Details in algorithm I will add after final test!
